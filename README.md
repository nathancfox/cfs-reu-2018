This project explores the use of a modified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
algorithm called COMB-PSO (Combined Continuous and Binary Particle Swarm
Optimization) on kinase inhibitor data. COMB-PSO is designed for feature
selection to use as input for a machine learning algorithm. In this case,
the feature subset selected by COMB-PSO will be fed to a classifer that labels
a kinase inhibitor as axon-growth inducing or not axon-growth inducing, based
on phenotypic assay data and in vitro kinase inhibition profiles.
