This work is from the Computing For Structure REU at the 
University of Miami, Summer 2018.

All data is stored in the datasets/ folder, but is not uploaded to this 
GitHub account because of size restrictions. The original source of the 
data can be found in the datasets/README.md and a copy of the data as it 
existed at the time of analysis can be requested from the author. The analysis 
is found in a Jupyter Notebook entitled MiamiDade_BulkyWastePickupOrders_Analysis.ipynb. 
This analysis is a work in progress and shows the actual narrative thought process. 
As such, it is not designed for presentation and includes content that may end up 
being omitted from future presentation of the work.
