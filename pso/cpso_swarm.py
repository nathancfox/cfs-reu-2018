# Evolutionary Functionality: 
#
#   It should record the progression of gbest and abest, and possibly
#   also each particle's pbest. It also maybe should pickle the classifier?
#   It also might want to take freezes of the initial states, and record
#   all the positions and velocities for each particle over time and export.
#   The fitness values should almost certainly be recorded and exported
#   because they take so much time to compute.
#
#   The program should be callable as a script with arguments. This means
#   that as many currently-hard-coded parameters should be class
#   attributes as possible, so that wrapper scripts using this class
#   can pass them as arguments. Maybe pass them in a dictionary?
#
#   The program should also have options on what data to store because
#   i/o affects runtime so much. If the entire path of each particle
#   is not needed, it shouldn't be recorded to file.

    """COMB-Particle Swarm Optimization (COMB-PSO) Swarm.

    COMB_Swarm is an implementation of a swarm object in
    Combined-Particle Swarm Optimization. It contains a group of
    COMB_Particle objects and maintains group attributes.

    Attributes
    ----------
    swarm : list, size npart; holds the swarm of COMB_Particle objects.

    npart : integer; number of particles in the swarm.
    
    gbest : 1-Dimensional ndarray, size ndim; Holds the global best position
            found by any particle in the swarm. Subject to reshuffling based
            on the "shuffle and archive" behavior in the COMB-PSO algorithm.

    g_fitness : float; the fitness value returned by eval_fitness for the
                current gbest.

                current abest.

            classification performance in evaluating fitness.

    x_bounds : float tuple, size 2; Holds lower/upper bounds for elements
               in the position vectors.

                 data_path, target_path):
        """Initialize the COMB_Swarm object.

        Initializes a COMB_Swarm object. The new COMB_Swarm then assigns its
        attributes and creates an empty Python list that will eventually hold
        the COMB_Particle objects. The actual initialization of the particles
        that make up the swarm is separated into the initialize_particles
        method because it involves npart calls to the eval_fitness method.
        This is potentially computationally expensive and should not be called
        during first initialization, instead called manually afterward.

        Parameters
        ----------
        npart : integer; number of particles in the swarm.

        c1 : float; acceleration coefficient for the cognitive component.

        c2 : float; acceleration coefficient for the social component.

        c3 : float; acceleration coefficient for the diversity component.

        ndim : integer; number of dimensions or features in the search space.
               Also the length of the position and velocity vectors.

        alpha : float, 系 [0.0, 1.0]; weights number of features vs.
                classification performance in evaluating fitness. If alpha
                = 1.0, classification performance is the only contributing
                factor to fitness. If alpha = 0.0, minimizing the number
                of features is the only contributing factor to fitness.

        test_size : float, 系 [0.0, 1.0]; designates the portion of the data
                    to be reserved for final testing.

        x_bounds : tuple of floats, size 2; x_bounds[0] is the minimum value
                   that an element of COMB_Particle.x can be; x_bounds[1]
                   is the maximum value that an element of COMB_Particle.x
                   can be.

        v_bounds : tuple of floats, size 2; v_bounds[0] is the minimum value
                   that an element of COMB_Particle.v can be; v_bounds[1]
                   is the maximum value that an element of COMB_Particle.v
                   can be.

        w_bounds : tuple of floats, size 2; w_bounds[0] is the minimum value
                   that w can be; w_bounds[1] is the maximum value that w can
                   be.

        t_bounds : tuple of integers, size 2; t_bounds[0] is the starting time
                   and should essentially always be 0, t_bounds[1] is the
                   end time or maximum time allowed (stopping condition).

        data_path : string; path to the .csv file holding the feature data.
                    The file should have one data point per line. Each line
                    should have all the features for that data point, separated
                    by commas. There should be no header row or index column.

        target_path : string; path to the .csv file holding the correct
                      classifications for the data points in the file pointed
                      to by data_path. This file should have 1 line with all
                      the labels, separated by commas.

    def initialize_particles(self):
        """Initialize the particles that comprise the swarm.

        Actually fills the empty list, swarm, with COMB_Particle objects.
        Separated particle initialization from the __init__ function
        because of a high computational time cost. Wrapper scripts using
        the COMB_Swarm class should manually initialize the particles.

        NOTE: The inertia coefficient, w, is not initialized here because
              it is updated based on gbinary as the very first thing in
              the actual run of the algorithm in execute_search. It is
              only initialized as a placeholder, 0.0 in the particle
              __init__. If you use these classes out of context, be
              sure to know that the w attribute may not be what you expect.

        NOTE: See "# NOTE REFERENCE" below. That line of code is manually
              initializing the p_fitness attribute for each COMB_Particle
              in the COMB_Swarm. The author recognizes that having to
              manually initialize an attribute from outside a class is
              horrible programming practice. However, this was a
              requirement for greater readability in this method. If the
              pbest attributes were stored in a data structure in the
              COMB_Swarm class, the for loop in execute_search would read as
              "for i in range(self.npart):" instead of "for p in self.swarm",
              causing all references to the COMB_Particle to be "swarm[i]"
              instead of "p", greatly reducing readability of the main
              algorithm of this class. Thus, the author decided to store
              each pbest attribute inside its respective COMB_Particle.
              Because the eval_fitness method is in the COMB_Swarm class,
              this means that the COMB_Particle cannot initialize its own
              pbest attribute. Thus, it is done here.

        Evaluates the fitness of the current binary position vector or feature

        classifier and test predictive performance.

        Fitness Function:

              |X| is the number of features (size of position vector)
