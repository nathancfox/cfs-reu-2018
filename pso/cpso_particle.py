class COMB_Particle:

    """COMB-Particle Swarm Optimization (COMB-PSO) Particle.

    COMB_Particle is an implementation of a particle object in
    Combined-Particle Swarm Optimization (COMB-PSO). It is designed to be
    used by a larger swarm class or swarm program.

    Attributes
    ----------
    x : 1-Dimensional ndarray; Holds the current particle position.
    
    v : 1-Dimensional ndarray; Holds the current particle velocity.

    b : 1-Dimensional ndarray; Holds the current binary position as
        an array of booleans.

    pbest : 1-Dimensional ndarray; Holds the particle's best position to date.

    pbinary : 1-Dimensional ndarray, size ndim; Holds the binary best position 
              converted from pbest as a list of booleans.

    p_fitness : float; the fitness value returned by COMB_Swarm.eval_fitness
                for the current pbest.

    w : float; inertia coefficient.
    
    c1 : float; acceleration constant 1, for the cognitive component.

    c2 : float; acceleration constant 2, for the social component.

    c3 : float; acceleration constant 3, for the diversity component.

    ndim : integer; number of dimensions in the search space; also the size
           of x, v, b, and pbest.

    x_bounds : float tuple; size 2; Holds upper/lower bounds for elements in x.

    v_bounds : float tuple; size 2; Holds upper/lower bounds for elements in v.

    w_bounds : float tuple; size 2; Holds upper/lower bounds for w.

   
    Functions
    ---------
    __init__ : Initializes a COMB_Particle object and assigns all attributes.

    update_position : Updates position based on velocity.

    update_velocity : Updates velocity based on the COMB-PSO velocity equation.

    initialize_position : Randomly initializes position.

    initialize_velocity : Randomly initializes velocity.

    update_binary_position : Updates binary position by converting current x.

        """Initialize the COMB_Particle object.

        Initializes a COMB_Particle object. The new COMB_Particle then randomly
        initializes its position, binary position, velocity, and pbest vectors,
        then assigns the inertia, c1, c2, c3 variables and the respective
        bounds.
        
        NOTE: p_fitness must be initialized in the swarm class because
        of a readability-based design decision.

        Parameters

        ndim : integer, number of dimensions or features in the search space.
               Also the length of the position and velocity vectors.

        x_bounds : tuple of floats, size 2, x_bounds[0] is the minimum value
                   that an element of x can be; x_bounds[1] is the maximum
                   value that an element of x can be.

        v_bounds : tuple of floats, size 2, v_bounds[0] is the minimum value
