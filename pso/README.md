# Particle Swarm Optimization

Development Space to implement the COMB-PSO algorithm.

Code is in Python 3.6, developed in Jupyter Notebook or as scripts.

**cpso_particle.py:** Implements a single particle as a class called
COMB\_Particle.

**cpso_swarm.py:** Implements a swarm of particles as a class called
COMB\_Swarm.

**cpso.py:** Wrapper script that runs a single instance of the COMB-PSO
algorithm, using cpso_particle.py and cpso_swarm.py.
