# Freezes
This folder holds code that I wanted to freeze at a specific point in
development. Each freeze consists of a single \*.zip file named
with the date that it was created in YYMMDD format. (e.g. January
10, 2015 = 150110)

180613     |cpso\_particle.py and cpso\_swarm.py holds the COMB\_Particle and COMB\_Swarm classes respectively. These two classes are designed to be used in a COMB-PSO algorithm implementation. They are the bare minimum, hold very little error catching functionality, and do not report anything or export any data. This is the lightest version of the implementation and has no wrapper scripts with it.
