# Experiment Brainstorming

## Independent Variable Options

* x_bounds
* v_bounds
* w_bounds
* t_bounds
* c1
* c2
* c3
* sigmoid function
* alpha
* number of particles
* classifier
* classifier scoring

## Dependent Variable Options

* Final accuracy
* Progression of fitness
* Progression of classifier score
* Final number of selected features
* Progression of number of selected features
* Progression of position
* Progression of velocity

## Thoughts

For the bounds variables, I should vary the center and the range independently.
I should be reporting most of the progression variables over time as a side
note on basically all the experiments.

I need to do benchmarking to get estimates on how long it will take to run
these experiments. Also, when I'm recording i/o
