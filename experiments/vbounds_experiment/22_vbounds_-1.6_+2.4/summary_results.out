Output Files
------------
  var_by_time.csv                : This is a csv file that holds the values of
                                   several variables as they vary over time
                                   during a single run of the algorithm. Each
                                   row represents a single time, each column is
                                   a single variable. The first row is a header
                                   row and contains labels for all the columns
                                   except the first one, which is time. It is
                                   expected that the time column will be used as
                                   an index in any DataFrames used to process
                                   this file and so no column label was given.

  abinary.csv                    : This is a csv file that holds the boolean
                                   vector returned as the optimum feature subset
                                   by the algorithm. It is a list of values
                                   where each value is either a 0 or 1. In the
                                   order given in the original data set or in
                                   the label vector, if the value is a 0, the
                                   feature is excluded. If the value is a 1, the
                                   feature is included.

  pickled_trained_classifier     : This is the trained classifier using the
                                   subset, abinary, of the randomly selected
                                   training data subsetted from the full feature
                                   data.

  X_train.csv                    : This is the subset of the feature data
                                   provided that was used as training data for
                                   the algorithm.

  y_train.csv                    : This is the subset of the target data
                                   provided that was used as training data for
                                   the algorithm.

  X_test.csv                     : This is the subset of the feature data
                                   provided that was used as testing data for
                                   the algorithm.

  y_test.csv                     : This is the subset of the target data
                                   provided that was used as testing data for
                                   the algorithm.

  cpso_script.py                 : This is the version of cpso.py that was used
                                   to generate this particular run of the
                                   algorithm.
